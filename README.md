Unsupervised machine learning involves training algorithms on data without labeled responses. The goal is to identify patterns, structures, and relationships within the data.

In this mini project, I've utilized the following unsupervised learning models:
\
Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
\
Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
